Dice_roller
===========

A very, very simple dice rolling app I wrote a while back and haven't gotten around to updating yet.

Overall, it's supposed to be a customized dice roller that provides randomized numbers in a variety of formats, including D&D rolls, rock/paper/scissors, coin flips, and even a couple customized rolls for rpg game systems (I think the only one included now is for a forum rpg system I was developing at the time).

This is the third incarnation of one of the first head-bangingly basic programs I wrote; even now, there's very little in it that you couldn't come up with on your own with a decent bit of thought. Unfortunately, this was written back when I wasn't as fanatical about commenting code; I still remember why things are named the way they are, and the reason I used what I used, so at some point I intend to sit down and pretty much re-write the whole thing to meet my new (higher) specifications.
